% HELPER TEXT - Remove before submission
% \subsection{Description of the "product" with references to theory}
% • Provide evidence of final product stage delivered by team
%
% \subsection{Experimental data}
% • Brief summary of experimental data
% • Detailed measurement data and intermediate calculations go in appendix
%
% General guidelines:
% • Present your results
% • All input variables should be properly explained
% • Reader should be able to reproduce calculations
% • Make sure figures and tables contain enough information in captions, axis labels etc.
% • Reader should gain good impression by studying figures and tables only

% \subsection{Analysis of results and influence of sources of error (reliability of results)}
% • Is final functionality as expected?
% • If deviations from functional specifications, what are reasons?
% • Evidence of compliance with quantitative specifications and theories
% • If deviations from expectation, explain reasons or sources of error
%
% \subsection{Comparison with theory and other products / services / systems}
% • Compare results against theoretical expectations
% • Consider engineering value metrics:
%   - Cost, size, performance
%   - Power and energy dissipation
%   - Accuracy, user friendliness
%   - Operational costs (maintenance, fuel, expertise)
% • Where does your product stand relative to others?
%
% General guidelines:
% • Give critical discussion and place work in correct context
% • Relate work to other calculations/studies
